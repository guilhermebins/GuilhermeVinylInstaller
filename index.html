              I have 8 years of experience with graphics installations. During
              this time, I have developed a variety of services, such as huge
              storefronts, vinyl on cars, trucks and even corporate event
              stands.
            </p>
            <p class="experiences-paragraph">
              My experience consists of careful, detailed and agile work. Always
              with the attention and precision that every graphic installation
              service requires.

              I feel good when I finish a job successfully, and that pleases the
              client. It is great to see the client's smile after a job that
              turned out beautifully and was completed efficiently.

            This was a small truck, where the challenge was to remove the old
            sticker and glue, and apply the new sticker in just one day. The day
            was cold, which made removal difficult, but did not prevent the job
            from being completed on time.
          </p>
          <p>
            A 3M J30 sticker was applied, which provided a very high-quality
            finish. And transparent automotive paint was applied to ensure
            greater longevity for the print.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even though it is a small job, it is a job to be happy about, due to
            the quality and completion within the proposed deadline.

        <p class="section__text">
          This is one of my favorite storefronts. Although it is not the largest
          I have ever installed, I really like it because of the variety of
          graphic colors. The biggest challenge was to carefully fit each part
          of the sticker so that the image looks like just one.
        </p>
        <p class="section__text">
          This service involved installing about 40 meters of stickers in
          approximately 3:30 hours. The client was very satisfied with the
          agility and quality of the service provided.

          I have already installed vinyl on several cars, from passenger cars to
          racing cars. I usually use Oracal vinyl as the material, which
          guarantees an excellent finish and durability for the client.

            My name is Guilherme Binsfeld da Silva, I am 26 years old. I am
            Brazilian and I currently live in Brazil. My hobbies are having
            barbecues with my family on the weekends, learning new things and
            having new experiences. I try to improve myself every day, so that I
            can enjoy life more wisely.
          </p>
          <p>
            My first jobs as a vinyl installer came into my life when I was 17
            years old. And since then I have been learning how to be more agile,
            perform better finishing, and improve with each installation.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am currently looking for an opportunity outside of Brazil. To gain
            new experiences and especially experience outside of the country
            where I was born. And I chose Canada to live. I have been preparing
            for this for about 4 years, so I consider my advanced level of
            English to be able to carry out the activities that are necessary
            even in a country with a different language.
          </p>
          <p>
            What about you? Would you like me to work for your company in
            Canada? Send me a message so we can talk about the possibility of
            making this goal happen.
